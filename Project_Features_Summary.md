# Project Features Implementation Summary

## 1. Secure Communication (TLS/SSL)

The project uses Java RMI over TLS/SSL to ensure all data transmitted between client and server is encrypted, preventing eavesdropping and tampering. This is achieved by configuring both the server and client to use a keystore and truststore, and by using SSL socket factories for RMI communication.

**How it works:**
- The server and client both load a keystore file containing the SSL certificate.
- All RMI calls are encrypted using TLS, so sensitive data (such as passwords) cannot be intercepted.

**Key Implementation:**
```java
// Server.java
System.setProperty("javax.net.ssl.keyStore", "server.keystore");
System.setProperty("javax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword", "abcd123");
System.setProperty("javax.net.ssl.trustStore", "server.keystore");
System.setProperty("javax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword", "abcd123");
Registry registry = LocateRegistry.createRegistry(
    1099,
    new SslRMIClientSocketFactory(),
    new SslRMIServerSocketFactory()
);
```
```java
// PayrollClient.java
System.setProperty("javax.net.ssl.trustStore", "server.keystore");
System.setProperty("javax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword", "abcd123");
Registry registry = LocateRegistry.getRegistry(
    "localhost", 1099, new SslRMIClientSocketFactory()
);
```

## 2. Multi-tasking (Multi-threading)

The server can handle multiple client requests concurrently. For example, user registration is performed in a separate thread, so the server can process other requests at the same time.

**How it works:**
- When a client calls the register method, the server spawns a new thread to handle the database operation.
- This prevents the server from being blocked by slow operations and improves scalability.

**Key Implementation:**
```java
// EmployeeServiceImpl.java
@Override
public boolean register(Employee employee) throws RemoteException {
    final boolean[] result = new boolean[1];
    Thread t = new Thread(() -> {
        result[0] = employeeDAO.insert(employee);
    });
    t.start();
    try {
        t.join();
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
        return false;
    }
    return result[0];
}
```
**Another Example:**
You could use an ExecutorService for more advanced thread management:
```java
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(10);
Future<Boolean> future = executor.submit(() -> employeeDAO.insert(employee));
boolean result = future.get();
```

## 3. Serialization

All data objects transferred via RMI (such as Employee and PayrollRecord) implement the `Serializable` interface, enabling automatic object serialization and deserialization. This allows objects to be sent over the network and reconstructed on the other side.

**How it works:**
- Java automatically serializes objects that implement `Serializable` when sending them via RMI.
- The receiver automatically deserializes the object.

**Key Implementation:**
```java
// Employee.java
public class Employee implements Serializable {
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
    private int id;
    private String username;
    // ...
}
```
**Example usage:**
```java
// Server side
Employee emp = new Employee();
emp.setUsername("alice");
// emp is sent to client via RMI and automatically serialized
```

## 4. Usability

The client uses a modern Swing GUI with clear input validation and user-friendly error messages, improving the overall user experience. All user input is checked before processing, and helpful dialogs are shown for errors.

**How it works:**
- Before submitting forms, the client checks that all required fields are filled.
- If not, a dialog is shown to the user.

**Key Implementation:**
```java
// PayrollClient.java (login input validation)
if (username == null || username.trim().isEmpty()) {
    JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(frame, "Username cannot be empty!", "Input Error", JOptionPane.WARNING_MESSAGE);
    return;
}
```
**Another Example:**
```java
if (password == null || password.trim().isEmpty()) {
    JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(frame, "Password cannot be empty!", "Input Error", JOptionPane.WARNING_MESSAGE);
    return;
}
```

## 5. Maintainability

The codebase is modular, well-commented, and follows OOP best practices, making it easy to understand and extend. Each class has a single responsibility, and methods are clearly documented.

**How it works:**
- Code is organized into packages: `client`, `server`, `common`.
- Each class and method has a clear purpose and documentation.

**Key Implementation:**
```java
/**
 * EmployeeServiceImpl provides RMI-based employee management services.
 * Handles registration, login, profile update, and employee queries.
 */
public class EmployeeServiceImpl extends UnicastRemoteObject implements EmployeeService {
    // ...
}
```
**Another Example:**
```java
// EmployeeDAO.java
public class EmployeeDAO {
    // Handles all database operations for Employee objects
}
```

## 6. Heterogeneity

The system is platform-independent (Java-based), and all data structures use simple types, making it easy to extend to other platforms or languages in the future.

**How it works:**
- All data transfer objects (DTOs) use primitive types and Strings.
- The system can be extended to support HTTP/JSON or other protocols for cross-language support.

**Key Implementation:**
```java
// Employee.java
public class Employee implements Serializable {
    private int id;
    private String username;
    private String password;
    // ...
}
```
- RMI protocol can be replaced with HTTP/JSON for cross-language support if needed.

## 7. Protocol

The project uses Java RMI as the communication protocol, which handles method invocation, data serialization, and network transport automatically.

**How it works:**
- The client looks up remote services via RMI registry.
- Method calls on the interface are transparently sent over the network.

**Key Implementation:**
```java
// EmployeeService.java
public interface EmployeeService extends Remote {
    boolean register(Employee employee) throws RemoteException;
    Employee login(String username, String password) throws RemoteException;
    // ...
}
```
**Example usage:**
```java
// Client side
EmployeeService service = (EmployeeService) registry.lookup("EmployeeService");
Employee emp = service.login("alice", "password123");
```

## 8. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

The project is designed using OOP principles: encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and interface-based programming.

### Encapsulation
Encapsulation means hiding the internal state of an object and only exposing safe methods to interact with it.

**Example:**
```java
public class Employee {
    private int id; // private field
    private String username;
    // Only accessible via getters/setters
    public int getId() { return id; }
    public void setId(int id) { this.id = id; }
    public String getUsername() { return username; }
    public void setUsername(String username) { this.username = username; }
}
```

### Inheritance
Inheritance allows a class to inherit fields and methods from another class.

**Example:**
```java
public class BaseDAO {
    // Common database utility methods
}

public class EmployeeDAO extends BaseDAO {
    // Inherits utility methods, adds Employee-specific logic
}
```

### Polymorphism
Polymorphism allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class or interface.

**Example:**
```java
public interface PayrollService {
    PayrollRecord calculatePayroll(int employeeId, String period);
}

public class PayrollServiceImpl implements PayrollService {
    @Override
    public PayrollRecord calculatePayroll(int employeeId, String period) {
        // Implementation
    }
}

// Usage
PayrollService service = new PayrollServiceImpl();
service.calculatePayroll(1, "2024-07");
```

### Interface-based Design
Interfaces define contracts that classes must implement, supporting loose coupling and flexibility.

**Example:**
```java
public interface EmployeeService {
    boolean register(Employee employee);
    Employee login(String username, String password);
}

public class EmployeeServiceImpl implements EmployeeService {
    // Implements all interface methods
}
```

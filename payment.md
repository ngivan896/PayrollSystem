# Automated Payroll Calculation and Report Generation System

## Overview
This system implements a complete automated payroll calculation process, including basic salary calculation, allowance management, EPF deductions, net salary calculation, and automated payroll report generation.

## Automated Payroll Calculation Process

### 1. Payroll Calculation Components
- **Base Salary**: Employee's basic monthly salary
- **Allowance**: Additional subsidies for transportation, housing, meals, etc.
- **Gross Pay**: Base salary + allowance
- **Deductions**: Mainly includes mandatory EPF 11% deduction
- **Net Pay**: Gross pay - deductions

### 2. EPF Automatic Deduction Mechanism
```java
// Automatic EPF deduction calculation (11%)
double epfDeduction = grossPay * 0.11;
double netPay = grossPay - epfDeduction;
```

### 3. Payroll Calculation Example
| Item | Amount (RM) |
|------|-------------|
| Base Salary | 3,000.00 |
| Allowance | 500.00 |
| Gross Pay | 3,500.00 |
| EPF Deduction (11%) | 385.00 |
| **Net Pay** | **3,115.00** |

## Payroll Report Generation

### 1. Report Content Structure
- Employee basic information (name, ID, position)
- Payroll period (year-month)
- Detailed salary composition
- Deduction details
- Final net salary

### 2. Automated Report Generation Process
1. **Data Collection**: Retrieve employee information and salary data from database
2. **Calculation Processing**: Automatically execute payroll calculation formulas
3. **Report Formatting**: Generate standardized payroll slip format
4. **Data Storage**: Save calculation results to database
5. **Report Output**: Generate viewable and exportable payroll slips

### 3. Report Generation Code Example
```java
public PayrollRecord calculatePayroll(int employeeId, String period) {
    // Get employee information
    Employee employee = employeeDAO.findById(employeeId);
    
    // Get base salary and allowance
    double baseSalary = employee.getBaseSalary();
    double allowance = employee.getAllowance();
    
    // Calculate gross pay
    double grossPay = baseSalary + allowance;
    
    // Calculate EPF deduction
    double deductions = grossPay * 0.11;
    
    // Calculate net pay
    double netPay = grossPay - deductions;
    
    // Create payroll record
    PayrollRecord record = new PayrollRecord();
    record.setEmployeeId(employeeId);
    record.setPeriod(period);
    record.setBaseSalary(baseSalary);
    record.setAllowance(allowance);
    record.setGrossPay(grossPay);
    record.setDeductions(deductions);
    record.setNetPay(netPay);
    
    return record;
}
```

## System Features

### 1. Automation Level
- **Zero Manual Intervention**: Payroll calculation is completely automated
- **Real-time Calculation**: Supports instant payroll calculation and queries
- **Batch Processing**: Can process multiple employees' payroll calculations simultaneously

### 2. Accuracy Assurance
- **Standardized Formulas**: Uses unified payroll calculation formulas
- **Data Validation**: Input data integrity checks
- **Calculation Verification**: Provides traceability of calculation processes

### 3. Flexibility
- **Customizable Allowances**: Supports different types of allowance configurations
- **Period Management**: Supports monthly, quarterly, and annual payroll calculations
- **Historical Records**: Complete payroll calculation history preservation

## User Interface Functions

### 1. Employee Side
- View personal payroll slips
- Payroll history record queries
- Detailed salary composition display

### 2. Administrator Side
- Batch payroll slip generation
- Payroll report management
- Payroll data statistical analysis

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Database Design
```sql
CREATE TABLE Payroll (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    employeeId INT,
    period VARCHAR(255),
    baseSalary DOUBLE,
    allowance DOUBLE,
    grossPay DOUBLE,
    deductions DOUBLE,
    netPay DOUBLE,
    FOREIGN KEY (employeeId) REFERENCES Employee(id)
);
```

### 2. Multi-threading Support
